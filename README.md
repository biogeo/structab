## structab
Several simple functions for treating structures as tables

Sometimes it's useful to have a struct serve as a table, where each field
represents a column. This mostly works fine as-is, but occasionally it's
nice to do slightly more complicated things, like concatenate the data
from two tables, or query or index a subset of the rows in the table. One
could create a Matlab class for tables with methods for these things.
That's a perfectly good solution, but a bit of a bother. Here's a few
simple functions to accomplish some basic tasks, plus a really easy way
to dump a large amount of data into an SQL table using the Database
Toolbox.

These functions consider a table to be:
1. A scalar struct
2. where each field is the same size in dimension 1 (rows)
3. such that the corresponding row entry in each field, taken together,
   make the "row" of a table.
Note that if you use the Database Toolbox, the results of SQL queries are
returned in this format.

These functions let you:
* Swap which dimension is the "row" dimension (e.g., you may have code
  operates on row vectors rather than column vectors): structab_swapdim
* Convert this to and from cell arrays where each cell represents an
  item in a row: structab2cell, cell2structab
* Convert this to and from struct arrays where each element represents
  a "row": structab2arr, structarr2tab
* Retrieve subsets of the table by index or condition: structab_index,
  structab_lookup
* For common types of tables (fields are either strings or numeric
  scalars), quickly and easily dump to text files: structab_filedump
* For these types of tables, dump to an SQL table via the Database
  Toolbox and a call to LOAD DATA INFILE -- for large amounts of data,
  this is MUCH (up to three orders of magnitude in a test I did) faster
  than using calls to INSERT.

Basically, this is just a quick-and-dirty solution. For something more
elegant, write a class.
